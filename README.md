## Getting started
After you clone the code:
  1. Set up and start [backend](https://github.com/Toccskefir/MonkeSwap_Backend) application
  2. Download the [expo go](https://expo.dev/go) application
  3. Run `npm install` in the project directory
  4. run `npm install -g expo-cli`
  5. Now you can run:

### `npx expo start`

This command runs the application in developement mode. 

Connect to the same network with your computer and mobile device. \
The command line will display a qr code, scan it with the expo go application. \
If you did all the steps correctly, the MonkeSwap Mobile application should start on your device.

The application has a file called [baseURL](https://github.com/Kolbi03/MonkeSwap-Mobil/blob/master/baseURL/baseURL.ts), you need to modify it to your own backend url.
